# FuseSoC Primitive Libraries Examples

A demonstration project highlighting two approaches to handling primitive libraries in FuseSoC-based HDL build systems.

## Overview

Primitive (prim) libraries are common amongst HDL projects targetting real hardware.
Usually, a project includes generic/transparent implementations, mirrored by target-specific/opaque implementations.
The generic implementations are typically written in native HDL and made compatible with logic simulators.
The target-specific implementations typically instantiate low-level primitives of the target ecosystem, such as ASIC standard library cells or FPGA programmable/hardened cells, for use in synthesis.
Building/swapping prim libraries is an important task for a build system used for simulation and/or synthesis.

There are two possible approaches for prim library support in FuseSoC: **virtual cores** or **filters**.

## Environment

The Nix shell provides all.

Install Nix using the instructions at: <https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install>

Start a project-specific development shell in the project directory using:

```sh
# In fusesoc-prim-lib-examples directory...
nix develop .
```

## Commands

Run the virtual cores example:

```sh
# In a `nix develop` shell...
fusesoc run hugom:example:virtual_cores
```
